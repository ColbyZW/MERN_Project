# MERN_Project
COP4331 Large MERN Project

## Environment Variables
Copy everything in the `.env-template` file into a new file called `.env`.  
After that go into the `.env` file and replace all of the fields that say `REPLACE ME` with the stuff pinned in Discord.  

## Running the Project in Docker
MAKE SURE YOU MADE THE `.env` file in the previous step.  Make sure you have Docker installed on your computer.  After that navigate into the project directory and run  
`docker-compose up`.  Once everything completes go to your browser and type in `localhost:3000`
